Vamp uses a service discovery pattern called server-side service discovery, which allows for service discovery without the need to change your code or run any other daemon or agent ([microservices.io - server side discovery](http://microservices.io/patterns/server-side-discovery.html)). In addition to service discovery, Vamp also functions as a service registry ([microservices.io - service registry](http://microservices.io/patterns/service-registry.html)).

For Vamp, we recognise the following benefits of this pattern:

* No code injection needed.
* No extra libraries or agents needed.
* platform/language agnostic: itâ€™s just HTTP.
* Easy integration using ENV variables.
