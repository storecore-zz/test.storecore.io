            <p>
              You can visit our website without providing us with any personal

              the order has been completely processed or your customer account
              cancelled, your data will be locked and deleted after the tax and
              commercial storage periods, provided you did not expressly agree
              to the further use of the data beyond this point.  Deleting your

              You can also set your browser to always inform you about the use

            <h2>Use of Google Analytics for web analysis</h2>
            <p>
              This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service
              provided by Google, Inc. (www.google.com).  Google Analytics
              uses cookies, i.e. text files stored on your computer to enable
              analysis of your website usage.
            </p>
            <p>
              Information generated by cookies about your website usage is
              usually transmitted to a Google server in the United States,
              where it is stored.  Because IP anonymization is active on this
              website, your IP address will be shortened in member states of
              the European Union and other states which are party to the
              Agreement on the European Economic Area
              (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>).  Only in
              exceptional cases, the full IP address will be transmitted to
              and shortened on a Google server in the United States.
              IP anonymization is active on this website: data from AMP
              documents is always IP anonymized.
            </p>
            <p>
              On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this
              information to evaluate your website usage, compile reports about
              website activity and other services related to website and
              Internet usage.  The IP address sent from your browser as part of
              Google Analytics is not merged with other data by Google.</p>

              You can refuse the use of cookies by adjusting your browser
              software; however, please note that if you do so, you might not
              be able to use the full functionality of our website.
              Furthermore, you can prevent Google’s collection and use of data

            <h2>Use of Google AdWords Conversion Tracking</h2>
            <p>
              This website uses Google AdWords Conversion Tracking, a web
              analysis service of Google, Inc. (“Google”).  Google AdWords
              Conversion Tracking also uses “cookies,” which are small text
              files that are stored on your computer system to facilitate an
              analysis of how you use the website.  These cookies lose their
              validity after 90 days and do not contain any information that
              can be used to identify you personally.  When a cookie is still
              valid, we can see that the user clicked on an ad from Google
              and proceeded to our page.  Every Google AdWords customer
              receives an individual cookie.  Therefore, Google AdWords
              customers cannot track cookies via their websites.
            </p>
            <p>
              The information collected using the cookie is used to create
              conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted for
              conversion tracking.  Customers learn about the total number of
              users who have clicked on their ad and were forwarded to a
              conversion tracking tag page.  However, they do not receive any
              information that can be used to personally identify the user.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you wish to opt-out from conversion tracking, you will have to
              deactivate the Google conversion tracking cookie in your browser
              settings.  After doing so, you will no longer be accounted for in
              the conversion tracking statistics.

              Retargeting technology makes it possible for us to address users
              who have already shown interest in our products with
              personalized, interest-based advertising.  The displayed
              advertisements are based on an analysis of previous user behavior
              using cookies.  Cookies are small text files that are stored on
              your computer or mobile device and do not save any personally
              identifiable information of the user.  With retargeting
              technology, a cookie is stored on your computer or mobile device
              in order to record anonymous data about your interests.
              Advertisements are then adapted individually based on the stored
              information.  This allows users to see advertisements that are
              highly likely to match their product and information interests.

              When you visit a page of our website that makes use of a social
              media plugin, your browser makes a direct connection with the
              servers of Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, or Instagram.
              The content of the plugin is passed from the respective provider
              to your browser and embedded on the web page.  By embedding the
              plugin, the provider receives the information that your browser
              has accessed the corresponding page of our website, even if you
              are not logged in or do not have a profile.  This information
              (including your IP address) is transmitted from your browser to
              the server of the provider in the USA, where it is stored.  If
              you are logged into one of the services, the provider can visit
              our website and directly link with your profile.  If you interact
              with the plugins, for example Facebook’s “Like”, Google’s “+1”,
              Twitter’s “Tweet” or the “Instagram” button, the corresponding
              information is also directly transmitted to and stores on the
              provider’s server.  The information is also published in the
              social network, on your Twitter wall or in your Instagram account
              and can be seen by your contacts.
